Design Choices

Tailwind CSS was used for rapid development and utility-first styling.

The Hero section uses large typography and visual hierarchy to draw attention.

Cards for courses provide a clean and modular way to display information with engaging visuals.

The Contact form is split into two visually distinct panels to increase clarity and accessibility.

Layout is optimized for both mobile and desktop with responsive grid and flexbox utilities.
